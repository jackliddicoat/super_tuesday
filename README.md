Analysis of Education and Voting by Town on Super Tuesday in the 2024 Republican Primary.

Voting data is from the NYTimes.

All education data is from the American Community Survey.

If you want to replicate my work, first run the 'scraped' file and then the 'join' file. Make sure to have all the packages I use as well in order to minimize confusion.
